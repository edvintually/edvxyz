a personal website for edvintually.
<br>
this website is actively being worked on, forgive me for any bugs and lack of support for various devices / resolutions.
<br>
due to my abitious website idea and my full time job, "v1" might take a while to be finished.

homepage, contacts, and error 404 page completed so far.
<br>
bio, portfolio, resource, and miscellaneous page planned for the future.

portfolio would include showcases of my art, animation, video effects, and music.
<br>
resources would include sample packs, and hopefully project files and video game mods down the line.
<br>
miscellaneous would include a gallery of stuff made for the website, credits, and a special thanks section.
